Subject: Hey fellow partner!

Glad to have you on board!

If everything went right, you're reading this mail on the ssh access I gave you
You're gonna work in the '~/hello_there' directory for now
Init everything, make yourself confortable
I'll send an email in a few minutes with some things to do

I use git by the way
Type 'git' to see what you can do

Andrew Stuck
